## Getting Started
- We are using **yarn** as a package manager so please don't do any **npm install** .
	- **yarn** is also same as **npm**.
-  VS code or preferred editor of your choice.

**Node js:**     	
Download node js : [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
After installing node : check for version of node and npm (node package manager )using
```
node -v 
v11.7.0  or (LATEST)
npm -v 
6.5.0   or (LATEST)
```
**Installing yarn package manager :**
*On MAC:*  
```
brew install yarn --without-node
```
after installing yarn check using  
```
yarn -v / yarn â€“version
```
To Upgrade Yarn  
```
brew upgrade yarn
```
Test that Yarn is installed by running:  
```
yarn -v / yarn --version
```
On Linux / CentOs  
```
sudo yum install yarn
```
***VsCode download:***  
			- For Mac , Linux and Windows User [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
*For Mac user :*  
- UnZip it and add it to the application

*For Cent-Os user* :  
- Go to the download Location, open terminal and use  
```sudo rpm -i <filename>.rpm```

**Extensions For VS Code :**
***Important :***
-   code-runner : Running vanila javaScript code.
-   ESLint : Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code.
-   Prettier - Code formatter: VS Code plugin for prettier/prettier

**Helpers:**
-   **Auto Close Tag** : Automatically add HTML/XML close tag.
-   **Color Highlight** : Highlight web colors in your editor.
-   **Bracket Pair Coloriser** : A customisable extension for colorising matching brackets
-   **Color Picker** : Helper with GUI to generate color codes such as CSS color notations
-   **JavaScript (ES6) code snippets** : Code snippets for JavaScript in ES6 syntax

-   **npm** : npm support for VS Code
-   **npm Intellisense :** plugin that autocomplet npm modules in import statements
-   **Path Intellisense** : Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames
-   **SCSS Intellisense** - Advanced autocompletion and refactoring support for SCSS

## Running in Local

### Pre-requisites: 
  These 3 are pre-requisites
  - vs code
  - node js
  - yarn (as a package manager)

  Also please add the vs-code extensions for better coding standards.

  You should have node version >= 8.5.4 

 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Update the package using 
		  ``` yarn install ```
          <br/>
		  Here you will see all the modules and the dependency getting downloaded.
          <br/>
          This will install dependency for both client and api.
 3. To start the local server : 
		 ``` yarn start  ```
         <br/>
		 This will start the local react server on : ``` http://localhost:3000```
         <br/>
         and
         <br/>
         This will start the local api server on : ``` http://localhost:5000```

Happy Coding !!!

## Folder Structure
After creation, your project should look like this:

```
|--node-react-boiler-plate/
    |--api/
    |	node api layer
    |--client/
    |   react-ui layer code.
    |--node_modules/
    |   node js modules
    |--.editorConfig
    |--.gitignore
    |--package.json
    |--README.md
    |--yarn.lock
```

## Available Scripts
Following are the scripts available:-
-  ### ```yarn install```
